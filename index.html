  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <p>A web page is a document that is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and is accessible on the internet or the World Wide Web. It is designed to be viewed by web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. 
    A web page can contain various types of content such as text, images, videos, links, and interactive elements such as forms and buttons. It can be static or dynamic, meaning that it can either display fixed information or change in response to user input or other factors. 
    Web pages are used for a variety of purposes, including sharing information, promoting products or services, conducting e-commerce, providing entertainment, and facilitating communication between individuals or groups.
    Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs the URL for a web page into their browser, the browser downloads an HTML file from a web server and transforms all of its elements into an interactive visual representation on the user's device.[4]
    If the user clicks, taps, or otherwise activates a hyperlink, the browser repeats this process to load the page pointed to by the hyperlink, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has user interface features that indicate which page is displayed.

    Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of various skills such as programming, design, and project management. 

Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a website or web application, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development deals with the server-side operations that make a website or web application work, such as databases, server languages (such as PHP, Ruby, or Python), and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

The process of web development typically includes planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying a website or web application. It can involve working with a team of developers, designers, and other professionals to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the client or end-users.

Some common tools and technologies used in web development include web development frameworks (such as Angular, React, or Vue), content management systems (such as WordPress or Drupal), version control systems (such as Git), and various web development tools and editors.
